    "The ```train.csv``` consits of a House Price dataset collected in USA. In this lab you are expected to use your knowledge in Feature Engineering and train a Machine Learning Algorithm to predict the House Price using this dataset. Each column of the dataset is clearly explained ```data_description.txt```\n",
